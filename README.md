The system architecture of Virtuo shows the interconnectivity between the various processes and sub-processes within the system. In this particular architecture, processes are represented by the various pages in the application (which represent a form of process that produces a definite output that leads to the next process) and sub-processes are depicted by minimal objectives within each page that help in the attainment of the page’s goal. See Appendix D for a diagram of Virtuo’s architecture.

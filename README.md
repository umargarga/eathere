Advanced Programming Project

This chapter describes the design of the Virtuo system. Based on the requirements documented in the previous chapter, the architectural design, interface design, component design, and database design were carefully constructed and depicted in the sub sections of this chapter. The database design was depicted in the form of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as well as the data dictionary that defined the data types of the entities in the ERD. The architectural design was depicted in the form of the System Architecture (see Appendix D for illustration). The component design was depicted using Use Case Models, Sequence Models, and an Activity Diagram. These models showed the sequence of events from the interaction and process perspectives. The data flow diagram showed the context of the system in relation to external entities (i.e. the User). The storyboard and wireframes depicted the interface design. Diagrams and models were not the only things introduced in this chapter. The different design methodologies as well as the ones that were chosen for this projectâ€™s design documentation were also discussed.
